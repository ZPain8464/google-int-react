# React Chat App With Custom Commands and Webhooks

This full-stack tutorial shows you how to create a chat app using Stream's [React Chat SDK](https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/react/) and incorporating [Stream Webhooks](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/react/webhooks_overview/?language=javascript) to enable custom `/slash` commands. 

To show you how to create custom commands, you'll integrate Google Sign-In and retrieve events from a Google calendar with the command `/gcal`.
